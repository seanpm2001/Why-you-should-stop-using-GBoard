## What is Google Summer of Code?

[Wikipedia: Google Summer of Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code?&useskin=monobook)

> The Google Summer of Code, often abbreviated to GSoC, is an international annual program in which Google awards stipends to contributors who successfully complete a free and open-source software coding project during the summer. As of 2022, the program is open to anyone aged 18 or over, no longer just students and recent graduates. It was first held from May to August 2005. Participants get paid to write software, with the amount of their stipend depending on the purchasing power parity of the country where they are located. Project ideas are listed by host organizations involved in open-source software development, though students can also propose their own project ideas. 

## Problems

The Google Summer of Code doesn't have too many problems, aside from their first event in 2005, which did not give users enough time to prepare their projects, it is mainly a problem if you want to cut ties to Google completely.

### Google Account

Participating in the GSoC requires a Google Account, which violates user privacy and security.

### Owned by Google

See above.
